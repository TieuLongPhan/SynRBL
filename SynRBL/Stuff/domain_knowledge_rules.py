def infer_chemical_rule_for_imputation(rule_dict, smiles_reactants, reactants_ratio, smiles_products, products_ratio, reaction_list):
    """
    Infers and appends a domain-knowledge-based chemical reaction rule to a reaction list for missing imputation in synthesis rebalancing.

    Validates the provided SMILES strings for reactants and products using RDKit. If valid, appends a dictionary 
    containing the rule, reactants, reactants ratio, products, and products ratio to the reaction list. The function 
    is specifically designed for inferring rules that require domain expertise in chemical synthesis.

    Parameters:
    rule_dict : dict
        A dictionary representing the rule to be inferred.
    smiles_reactants : str
        SMILES representation of reactants.
    reactants_ratio : int
        Stoichiometric ratio of reactants.
    smiles_products : str
        SMILES representation of products.
    products_ratio : int
        Stoichiometric ratio of products.
    reaction_list : list
        List to which the inferred reaction rule will be appended.

    Returns:
    list
        The updated reaction list containing the newly inferred reaction rule.

    Example:
    >>> reaction_list = []
    >>> new_reaction = infer_chemical_rule_for_imputation(rule_dict={"O":1}, smiles_reactants='[HH]', reactants_ratio=1, 
    ...                                     smiles_products='[OH-].[H+]', products_ratio=1, reaction_list=reaction_list)
    >>> new_reaction
    [[{'rule_dict': {'O': 1}, 'smiles_reactants': '[HH]', 'reactants_ratio': 1, 'smiles_products': '[OH-].[H+]', 'products_ratio': 1}]]
