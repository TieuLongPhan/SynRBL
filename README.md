## Installation

To install and set up the SynRBL framework, follow these steps. Please ensure you have Python 3.9 or later installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- RDKit
- NetworkX
- PySmiles
- tmap
- map4

### Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Python Installation:**
  Ensure that Python 3.9 or later is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Creating a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
  It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects or system-wide packages. Use the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  python -m venv synrbl-env
  source synrbl-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `synrbl-env\Scripts\activate`
  ```
  
3. **Installing Required Packages:**
  Install the necessary packages using pip. RDKit might require additional steps to install, which you can find in the RDKit documentation.

  ```bash
  pip install rdkit networkx pysmiles tmap map4

4. **Cloning and Installing SynRBL:**
  Clone the SynRBL repository from GitHub and install it:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/TieuLongPhan/SynRBL.git
  cd SynRBL
  pip install .

5. **Verify Installation:**
  After installation, you can verify that SynRBL is correctly installed by running a simple test or checking the package version.

  ```python
  python -c "import SynRBL; print(SynRBL.__version__)"
