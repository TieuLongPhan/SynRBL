# SynRBL: Synthesis Rebalancing Framework

SynRBL is a toolkit tailored for computational chemistry, aimed at correcting imbalances in chemical reactions. It employs a dual strategy: a rule-based method for adjusting non-carbon elements and an mcs-based (maximum common substructure) technique for carbon element adjustments.

## Installation

The easiest way to use SynRBL is by installing the PyPI package 
[synrbl](https://pypi.org/project/synrbl/). 

Follow these steps to setup a
working environment. Please ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed on 
your system.

### Prerequisites
The requirements are automatically installed with the pip package.

- Python 3.11
- rdkit >= 2023.9.4
- joblib >= 1.3.2
- seaborn >= 0.13.2
- xgboost >= 2.0.3
- scikit_learn == 1.4.0
- imbalanced_learn >= 0.12.0
- reportlab >= 4.1.0
- fgutils >= 0.0.15

### Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Python Installation:**
  Ensure that Python 3.11 or later is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Creating a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
  It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects or system-wide packages. Use the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  python -m venv synrbl-env
  source synrbl-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `synrbl-env\Scripts\activate`
  ```
  Or Conda

  ```bash
  conda create --name synrbl-env python=3.11
  conda activate synrbl-env
  ```

3. **Install with pip:**

  ```bash
  pip install synrbl
  ```

4. **Verify Installation:**
  After installation, you can verify that SynRBL is correctly installed by running a simple test.

  ```python
  python -c "from synrbl import Balancer; bal = Balancer(n_jobs=1); print(bal.rebalance('CC(=O)OCC>>CC(=O)O'))"
  ```

## Usage
### Use in script
  ```python
  from synrbl import Balancer
  
  smiles = (
    "COC(=O)[C@H](CCCCNC(=O)OCc1ccccc1)NC(=O)Nc1cc(OC)cc(C(C)(C)C)c1O>>"
    + "COC(=O)[C@H](CCCCN)NC(=O)Nc1cc(OC)cc(C(C)(C)C)c1O"
  )
  synrbl = Balancer()
  
  results = synrbl.rebalance(smiles, output_dict=True)
  >> [{
        "reaction": "COC(=O)[C@H](CCCCNC(=O)OCc1ccccc1)NC(=O)Nc1cc(OC)cc(C(C)(C)C)c1O.O>>"
        + "COC(=O)[C@H](CCCCN)NC(=O)Nc1cc(OC)cc(C(C)(C)C)c1O.O=C(O)OCc1ccccc1",
        "solved": True,
        "input_reaction": "COC(=O)[C@H](CCCCNC(=O)OCc1ccccc1)NC(=O)Nc1cc(OC)cc(C(C)(C)C)c1O>>"
        + "COC(=O)[C@H](CCCCN)NC(=O)Nc1cc(OC)cc(C(C)(C)C)c1O",
        "issue": "",
        "rules": ["append O when next to O or N", "default single bond"],
        "solved_by": "mcs-based",
        "confidence": 0.999,
    }]
  ```

### Use in command line
  ```bash
  echo "id,reaction\n0,CC(=O)OCC>>CC(=O)O" > unbalanced.csv
  python -m synrbl run -o balanced.csv unbalanced.csv
  ```
    
### Benchmark your own dataset
  Prepare your dataset as a csv file *datafile* with a column *reaction* of
  unbalanced reaction SMILES and a column *expected_reaction* containing the
  expected balanced reactions.    
  
  Rebalance the reactions and forward the expected reactions column to the
  output.
  ```bash
  python -m synrbl run -o balanced.csv --col <reaction> --out-columns <expected_reaction> <datafile>
  ```
  
  After rebalancing you can use the benchmark command to compute the success
  and accuracy rates of your dataset. Keep in mind that an exact comparison 
  between rebalanced and expected reaction is a highly conservative 
  evaluation. An unbalance reaction might have multiple equaly viable 
  balanced solutions. Besides the exact comparison (default) the benchmark 
  command supports a few similarity measures like ECFP and pathway 
  fingerprints for the comparison between rebalanced reaction and the 
  expected balanced reaction.
  
  ```bash
  python -m synrbl benchmark --col <reaction> --target-col <expected_reaction> balanced.csv
  ```

### Reproduce benchmark results from validation set
  To test SynRBL on the provided validation set use the following commands.
  Run these commands from the root of the cloned repository.
  
  Rebalance the dataset
  
  ```bash
  python -m synrbl run -o validation_set_balanced.csv --out-columns expected_reaction ./Data/Validation_set/validation_set.csv
  ```
  
  and compute the benchmark results
  ```bash
  python -m synrbl benchmark validation_set_balanced.csv
  ```
